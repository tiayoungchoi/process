  <p>A Korean corporal who had embarked on a maritime search mission was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head.
    Military investigators and the police are focusing on the possibility that the corporal may have taken his own life,
    while not ruling out the <span class="highlight" data-original="">chance of an accidental discharge</span>.</p>

  <p>According to the Marine Corps, on the morning of the 13th, at a unit on Daechungdo in Ongjin County, Incheon,
    Corporal A was found dead. A unit officer discovered Corporal A collapsed in the driver’s seat of a military truck
    with a gunshot wound to the forehead and reported it immediately. Emergency treatment was administered, but he was
    officially pronounced dead at 9:01 a.m. on the 13th.</p>

  <p>An autopsy revealed that Corporal A had been shot by a <span class="highlight"

    even after the funeral.</p>

  <p>In addition to Corporal A, there have been a series of recent incidents in the military that were concluded as
