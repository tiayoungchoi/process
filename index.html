  <p>Experiment...[1]</p>

  <p>My first experiment was aimed to recreate the 'Bush hid the facts' bug with html. When you type something into the input, the it will randomise those English characters into a random Chinese character. Try to write something below to see how it works. </p>
  <input type="text" id="englishInput1" placeholder="type something...">
  <div><span id="chinese1"></span></div>

  <p>Experiment...[2]</p>

  <p>My second experiment was to try figure out how to 'fix' the bug. When the far rights view media, they have this lens where they would see anything as Chineses' doing. Therefore I got a random article from the media and changed all the proper nouns to 'China' or 'Chinese'. However, if you hover on these proper nouns, you can see the 'truth', the original version of the article. This was my first attempt on 'fixing' this bug.(on mobile, click instead on hover)</p>

  <p>Experiment...[3]</p>

  <p>My third experiment was inspired by Jenny Holzer, where she recreated FBI documents that has been shown to the public, where the documents have black markers on the confidential information. However these black marker lines sometimes create conspiracy theories, making the public think "what are they hiding?". Therefore I tried to recreate this by getting an article online and blacking out all the proper nouns. The 'fixing' of the bug can be done by highlighting the blacked out words, where it reveals the original words.</p>

  <p>Experiment...[4]</p>
  <p>Experiment 4 was aimed to combine all the experiments that I had done. Therefore when some types something, it changes into a randomised Chinese character (from experiment 1), along with the blacked out characters (from experiment 3). However if you hover, it reveals what you really typed (experiment 3).</p>
  <input type="text" id="englishInput" placeholder="type something and press enter...">
  <div id="chinese2"></div>
  <div id="log"></div>

  <p>Final...[1]</p>
  <p>I had to come up with an idea to finalise the experiments I've did. In Korea, there's a term called "Keyboard Battle", indicating people fighting online. With the two vectorised men at the bottom, I wanted to create this scene of "keyboard battle", where the "leftist" is on the left, "rightist" is on the right (quite literal!)... and whatever you type, the extreme rightist would view it as Chinese related. However, if you hover to see the truth with the custom eye cursor that I've made, you can see what the truth is. The idea was that at the end it would almost create a pattern of these Chinese characters when people come to type some stuff on them.</p>
  <iframe src="final1.html" title="description"></iframe>

  <p>Final...[2]</p>
  <p>I felt like something is missing, so I thought the extereme rightist could say some common phrases that actual extreme rightists say online, such as "I'm going to report you to CIA" (as most extreme rightists in Korea are Trump Supporters and they believe if they are pro-China they should never ever enter the US territory) I have also added some famous meme quotes where the CEO of Tiktok was interrogated by the US government because they are famous to be sinophobic.</p>
  <iframe src="final2.html" title="description"></iframe>

  <p>Final...[final]</p>

  <p>...however the website felt a bit bland. And without explaiation it would have been difficult for people to understand the Korean politics going on here. Therefore with the about button, I added few contexts and this about pop up opens up as soon as you open the website. I also stylised to reflect the early web design, as my original bug was from Windows XP, thus wanted reflect the design in that era. I also felt like aligning everything to either right or left a bit restricting, so I made the Chinese characters are full width and the red text being randomly placed. Also because I really liked the pattern it creates when people leave many stuff, I added the print button that allows to print out the pattern.</p>
